DevExpress ASP.NET Web Forms: ASPxGridView



In that project i use Dev Express ASPxGriedView Grid View to connect with a database and show results.


1. Firstly i have started a new project  "DevExpress 21.2 Web App Template Gallery". 

2. I add a Web Form with Master page.

3. Then i have added ASPxGridView Control in Sales.aspx page.

4. Finally i configure ASPxGridView.


We can add Edit- Add -Delete Button.
WE can add our Grid to a new memu
We can also Batch editing.
And we can filtering data.
